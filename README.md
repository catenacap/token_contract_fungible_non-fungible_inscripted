# tokencontract-fungible-inscripted
Following is a method for which you can create ERC20 like tokens with a inscription within each token, which makes it a hybrid of ERC20 + ERC721  or ERC115


Following discussions with a Former SEC lawyer on twitter based on his statements fungible tokens are prime for designation as securities, whereas stamps are not, when in fact they are both similar as in gas within their various systems.

However Stamps are considered collectable, where as NFT's non-fungible, thus for US devs they may wish to consider the idea of incorporating ERC20 + ERC721/ERC115 to launch tokens which are both fungible but have non-fungible aspects making them gas but also collectables, thus not securities.
